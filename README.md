This repository contains supplementary material for the publication by [Puzniak et al., in preparation](https://doi.org/10.25663/brainlife.pub.9) consisting of scripts for:
- data uploading, 
- offline preprocessing,
- technical validation (outputting plots).

The supplementary MATLAB files with detailed information about fMRI acquisition (necessary for analysis of the retinotopic data) are stored in the [OSF repository](https://osf.io/xz29q/).
