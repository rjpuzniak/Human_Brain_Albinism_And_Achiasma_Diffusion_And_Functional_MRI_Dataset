__Figure 5. Participants' motion during DW scan.__ Left plot displays motion in the DW volumes (expressed as Root Mean Square of voxel displacements within brain mask, calculated with respect to the first volume) where 138 volumes with AP PED were followed by 138 volumes with opposite PED. Markers indicate the values calculated for the b0 volumes. The right-hand plot displays the mean motion RMS calculated for each participant. The color code and markers shape correspond to groups: orange circle - control, magenta square - albinism, violet up-pointing triangle - achiasma, blue down-pointing triangle - chiasma hypoplasia.

### Reproducing the results
The motion estimation was performed using `eddy` command from FSL software, which outputs this information in the `eddy_movement_rms` files. Those files are provided in the `Data` folder, together with a sample file with information about b-values `gradient_table.bval` (in order to mark b0 volumes). The above displayed image can be generated by downloading the folder and running the provided MATLAB script `plot_motion.m`, which will create `Fig5a_Motion.jpg` file.
