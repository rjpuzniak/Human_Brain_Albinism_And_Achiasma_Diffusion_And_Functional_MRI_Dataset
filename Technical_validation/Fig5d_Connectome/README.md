__Figure 7. Quality of derived tractogram.__ Results of evaluation of tractogram using LiFE method. Y-axis displays the number of fascicles remaining after filtering with LiFE, x-axis displays voxel-wise  error between original signal and the one predicted from optimized tractograms. The bright markers correspond to the published datasets, while the dimmed display results for representative datasets from other publicly available DW repositories (such as 3T and 7T HCP datasets).


### Reproducing the results
The figure is generated by running MATLAB `plot_Connectome` script, which output `Fig5d_Connectome` figure. The script reads the data provided in the `Data` folder, which contains output of `LiFE (dwi)` [App](https://doi.org/10.25663/bl.app.104) for CHIASM datasets.
