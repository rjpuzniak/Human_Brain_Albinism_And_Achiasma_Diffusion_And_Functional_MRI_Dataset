__Figure 5. SNR of DW data in corpus callosum and optic chiasm.__ SNR for each participant calculated from callosal voxels (selected from: raw AP DWI series, raw PA DWI series, and corrected DWI) and optic chiasm (only for corrected DWI). The SNR is reported for diffusion weighting along x-axis, y-axis and z-axis (top row, from left to right, respectively), where axes are defined with regard to AC-PC space. Bottom row displays SNR in absence of diffusion weighting (b0 image).

### Reproducing the results
The plot is generated by running MATLAB `plot_SNR_subplots` script, which outputs .jpg file `SNR_in_b0.jpg`. The script takes as an input the data stored in `../Figure5b_SNR/Data`, which needs to be collected priorly to running the script (detailed instructions are provided at `../Figure5b_SNR`).
