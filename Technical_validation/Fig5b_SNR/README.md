__Figure 5. SNR in corpus callosum and optic chiasm in b0 images.__ SNR in b0 images for each participant calculated from callosal voxels (selected from raw AP PED DW series, raw PA PED DW series, and corrected DWI) and optic chiasm (only for corrected DWI).

### Reproducing the results
The plot is generated by running MATLAB `plot_SNR` script, which outputs .jpg file `SNR_in_b0.jpg`. However, prior to running the script, it is necessary to copy several folders to the `Data` folder, as they couldn't be stored on Github. Specifically:
 -`SNR_CC_AP` - is a missing folder that contains output of brainlife.io `Compute SNR in Corpus Callosum` [App](https://brainlife.io/app/5bca308550fdf50028c6342c) run on the raw DW data with Anterior-Posterior encoding direction. In order to restore this folder please copy the .zip file `SNR_in_DWI_images` from the project's [OSF repository](https://osf.io/xz29q/) to the `Data` folder and unzip it.
- `SNR_CC_PA` - is analogical to `SNR_CC_AP` files, but contains output for DWI images encoded with opposite phase encoding direction (Posterior-Anterior). This file with be produced by unzipping the above described .zip file.
- `SNR_CC_clean` - similarly to previous files contains estimates of SNR in CC, but in the corrected DWI files, and is also stored in .zip file.
- `SNR_OC_clean` - contain estimates of SNR in the optic chiasm, this data is already provided in the Github repo. Specifically, the data was created by running a batch script `wrapper_snr`, which evoked Python `snr_in_oc` script in order to calculate SNR in optic chiasm. The `snr_in_oc` script is a modified version of `Compute SNR in Corpus Callosum`, where the calculations are performed on provided optic chiasm mask instead of callosal mask estimated directly from the data.
